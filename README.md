# Monty Hall Problem test

This program was made to prove me wrong about my assumption that in [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) there is no difference between switching or staying. Results proved that switching is the winning strategy.

All parameters (Number of doors and total amount of tries) are currently hard-coded and since this is just a quick proof I'm not going to develop argument parsing. Just change the constants.
